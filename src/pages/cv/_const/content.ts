  summary:
    `As a node.js developer I specialize on building scalable and reliable back-end systems. I prefer to use a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach in my work, or at least try to incorporate it as much as possible.. I am enthusiastic about continually enhancing my skills and have a keen interest in learning new technologies. I find joy in exploring emerging JavaScript runtimes, such as Deno, and am excited about delving into Rust in the future. Although I possess experience in React, my primary focus lies outside frontend development, as I am more drawn to other areas within the programming landscape.`,
