# `1 explicit PR => multiple deploys`

> That is what I want to play with today!

## Spoiler:


```yaml title=deploy.yml

name: Deploy all target by pushing into main only
env:
  CURRENT_BRANCH: ${{ github.head_ref || github.ref_name }}
  EXPLICIT_PUSH_BRANCH: main
  IMPLICIT_DEPLOY_BRANCHES: "deploy-1 deploy-2 deploy-3"
on:
  pull_request: # will be making explicitly
    branches:
      - ${{ env.CURRENT_BRANCH }}
  push: # after PR these pushes will be triggered implicitly
    branches: [deploy-1, deploy-2, deploy-3]
jobs:
  general:
    name: General for any workflow (branch)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: show token // TODO rm
        run: echo ${{ secrets.SUPER_GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Clone repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.SUDO_GH_TOKEN }}

      - name: Current branch
        run: echo ${{ env.CURRENT_BRANCH }}

{/* <!-- truncate -->s */}

      - name: Workflow for explicit push to main branch that should trigger another updates/synchronizations and own workflows
        if: ${{ env.CURRENT_BRANCH == env.EXPLICIT_PUSH_BRANCH }}
        run: >
          git config user.name workflow-bot &&
          git config user.email workflow-bot@mail.com &&
          git checkout -b t1-deploy-1 &&
          git push origin t1-deploy-1 --force &&
          git checkout -b t1-deploy-2 &&
          git push origin t1-deploy-2 --force
```

# So when it can be handy?

* You have some apis, maybe frontends written for example on typescript that allow you to write some libraries that will share their code between these applications. For example types or validators or maybe event services or components. So you omit code-duplication and get code-synchronizations for sharing-layer between your applications out of the box.

* Is it cool? Yes, if it is really monorepo but not monolite...

* So we have some independent applications but single repository => all deploys should be updated after code changing.

* That's why will be cool to make pull-request that will be automatically trigger updating another deploys.
